🌾 Problem Statement:


In India, a large number of farmers still face challenges due to limited access to timely and reliable information related to weather, market prices, quality agricultural inputs, and modern farming techniques. Even if two farmers have the same soil and land size, their crop yield can differ drastically due to disparities in knowledge, tools, and raw materials.

There is also a lack of direct market access, making farmers dependent on middlemen, leading to reduced profits. Furthermore, many farmers are uneducated or semi-literate, making it difficult for them to understand written instructions or digital content.

EarthWormX is designed to solve these challenges by offering an end-to-end “Seed to Sell” digital solution that provides audio-guided instructions, smart tools, and transparent market access to empower farmers.
